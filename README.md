#What is it?

    [slide 2]
    
A blockchain is a decentralized, distributed, and often public, digital ledger that is used to record transactions across many computers so that any involved record cannot be changed retroactively, without the changing of all next blocks. This allows the members to verify transactions independently. A blockchain database is managed autonomously using a peer-to-peer network and a distributed timestamping server. The use of a blockchain removes the characteristic of infinite reproducibility from a digital asset. 

    [slide 3]
    
Blocks hold batches of valid transactions that are hashed and encoded into a Merkle tree. Each block includes the cryptographic hash of the prior block. The linked blocks form a chain. This iterative process confirms the integrity of the previous block, all the way back to the original genesis block. 

    [slide 4]
    
Sometimes separate blocks can be produced separately, creating a temporary fork. In addition to a secure hash-based history, any blockchain has a specified algorithm for scoring different versions of the history so that one with a higher score can be selected over others.
Peer-to-peer blockchain networks haven’t centralized points that can be easily attacked. Likewise, it has no central point of failure.

#Uses

    [slide 5]
    
Blockchain technology can be integrated into multiple areas. The primary use of blockchains today is as a distributed ledger for cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin. Businesses haven’t used blockchain technology often.

#Cryptocurrencies

    [slide 6]
    
Most cryptocurrencies use blockchain technology to record transactions. For example, the bitcoin
    [slide 7]
network and Ethereum network are both based on blockchain. On 8 May 2018 Facebook confirmed that it would open a new blockchain group which would be headed by David Marcus,
    [slide 8]
who previously was in charge of Messenger. Facebook's planned cryptocurrency platform, Libra, that was announced in 2019.

#Smart contracts

    [slide 10]
    
Blockchain-based smart contracts are contracts that can be partially or fully executed without human interaction. One of the main objectives of a smart contract is automated escrow. An IMF staff discussion reported that smart contracts based on blockchain technology might reduce moral hazards and optimize the use of contracts in general.

    [slide 11]
    
#Financial services

Major portions of the financial industry are implementing distributed ledgers for use in banking.
    [slide 12]
Banks are interested in this technology because it has potential to speed up their systems.
Banks are opening new research labs dedicated to blockchain technology in order to explore how blockchain can be used in financial services.
Berenberg, a German bank, believes that blockchain is an "overhyped technology" that has had a large number of "proofs of concept", but still has major challenges, and very few success stories.
In December 2018, Bitwala launched Europe's first regulated blockchain banking solution that enables users to manage both their bitcoin and euro deposits in one place.

    [slide 13]
    
#Types

Currently, there are at least three types of blockchain networks — public blockchains, private blockchains and hybrid blockchains.

#Public blockchains

    [slide 14]

A public blockchain has absolutely no access restrictions. Anyone with an Internet connection can send transactions to it as well as become a validator. Usually, such networks offer economic motivation for those who secure them and use some type of a Proof of Stake or Proof of Work algorithm.

Some of the largest, most known public blockchains are the bitcoin blockchain and the Ethereum blockchain.

#Private blockchains

    [slide 15]
    
A private blockchain is permissioned. One cannot join it unless invited by the network administrators. Member and validator access is restricted.

#Hybrid blockchains

    [slide 16]
    
A hybrid blockchain has a combination of centralized and decentralized features. The exact workings of the chain can change based on which portions of centralization decentralization are used.
